Team 18 – HCI Final Project: Virtual Hotel Concierge Furhat Interaction Study

This file contains all relevant information about the content of the project and the steps being followed in the implementation and the experiments. 

1. Consent Forms:
   - Concent_form_HCI_official.pdf 
     Original format given to the participants.
   - CF_participant1.pdf to CF_participant8.pdf
     These are signed consent forms from all participants involved in the user study.

2. Pre/Post-Interaction Questionnares:
   - pre_interaction_survey.xlsx
   - post_interaction_survey.xlsx
     Collecting questionnaire data from users before and after their interaction with the Furhat agent.

3. Experiment Video:
   - Experiment_Team18.mov
     A video recording of the Furhat interaction experiment conducted with 8 participants in a hotel setting simulating real-life scenario of interaction.

   ➤ Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the full experiment video (1.54 GB) is hosted externally.

     A statistical test result visualization from the analysis phase using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Testing.
   
5. Furhat Implementation:
   - furhat_implementation_code/ (folder)
     Contains source code and configuration files used for programming the Furhat robot, extracted from the app.

     Visual representation of our implementation.

   **Blockly Skill File (Split Archive)**
   Because the original Blockly skill file exceeded GitHub’s 25 MB upload limit, it was compressed and split into smaller parts.

   Uploaded files:
   - blockly_part_aa
   - blockly_part_ab
   - blockly_part_ac

   To reconstruct the original file:
   ```bash
   cat blockly_part_* > blockly_compressed.zip
   unzip blockly_compressed.zip
